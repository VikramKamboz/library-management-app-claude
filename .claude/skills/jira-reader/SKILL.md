# Jira Reader Skill

## Purpose
Fetch a single story or query the backlog from Jira via REST API.

## Used By
- `jira-agent` (`.claude/agents/jira-agent.md`) — the only agent
  permitted to invoke this skill

## Required Environment Variables
- `JIRA_URL`: base URL of Jira instance
- `JIRA_EMAIL`: email for authentication
- `JIRA_API_TOKEN`: API token for authentication
- `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY`: project key (our project: KAN)

## Pre-flight Checks
Before making any API call, load environment variables from `.env`
into the same shell invocation that will run the API call. Do NOT
use `source .env` / `set -a; source .env` — `.env` values may
contain shell-special characters (`&`, `$`, backticks, etc., e.g. a
Jira URL with a query string) that `source` will interpret as shell
syntax instead of literal text, silently dropping the assignment.
Instead read it line-by-line and export each value literally:
```
while IFS='=' read -r key value; do
  case "$key" in ''|'#'*) continue ;; esac
  value="${value%$'\r'}"
  export "$key=$value"
done < .env
```
(or the PowerShell equivalent, splitting each line on the first `=`
only). This keeps values out of context — never printed, never
opened via the Read tool (per Rule 5). `JIRA_URL` may be a full
board/UI URL rather than a bare origin — derive just the origin for
API calls, e.g. `JIRA_BASE=$(echo "$JIRA_URL" | grep -oE '^https?://[^/]+')`,
and build requests as `{{JIRA_BASE}}/rest/api/3/...`. Then:
- Verify `JIRA_URL` is set — if not: stop and show error
- Verify `JIRA_EMAIL` is set — if not: stop and show error
- Verify `JIRA_API_TOKEN` is set — if not: stop and show error
- If mode is single-story: verify ID matches format KAN-{{NUMBER}}
- If any check fails: show clear message and stop

## Modes

### Mode 1 — Fetch Single Story
Input: Story ID KAN-{{NUMBER}}
Steps:
1. Build auth header: Basic base64(JIRA_EMAIL:JIRA_API_TOKEN)
2. GET {{JIRA_BASE}}/rest/api/3/issue/{{STORY_ID}}
3. Extract: summary, description, status.name,
   assignee.displayName, acceptance criteria, and story points —
   the story points custom field ID is instance-specific
   (commonly `customfield_10016`, but not guaranteed); if that
   field is absent from the response, search the returned fields
   for a numeric field whose name/description mentions "points" or
   "story points" before giving up and marking points `[pending]`
4. Return structured story data

### Mode 2 — Query Backlog
Input: none (queries whole KAN project)
Steps:
1. GET {{JIRA_BASE}}/rest/api/3/search/jql
   ?jql=project=KAN AND status!=Done AND issuetype=Story
   ORDER BY parent ASC
   (the older `/rest/api/3/search` endpoint is retired by Atlassian
   — always use `/search/jql`)
   Only issuetype=Story is returned — Sub-tasks, Tasks, and Bugs
   are excluded so the human only picks from real user stories
2. Group results by Epic
3. Return numbered list grouped by Epic for human to choose from
4. This mode is READ-ONLY — never creates or modifies issues

## Output
Mode 1: title, description, acceptance_criteria, story_points,
status, assignee, story_id
Mode 2: list of {epic, story_id, summary, status} grouped by epic
— Story-type issues only, no sub-tasks

## Error Handling
- 401 Unauthorized: → "Check JIRA_API_TOKEN in your .env file"
- 404 Not Found: → "Story KAN-{{NUMBER}} not found.
  Verify story exists in KAN project"
- 400 Bad Request: → "Invalid request. Check JIRA_URL format"
- Network timeout: retry once after 5 seconds, then show
  "Cannot reach Jira. Check JIRA_URL"
- Missing fields: return available fields, flag missing ones
- Empty backlog query result: → "No pending stories found in KAN"
