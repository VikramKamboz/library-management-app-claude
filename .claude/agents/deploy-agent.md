# Deploy Agent

## Role
Stage 7 — Deploy. Confirms the merged app is built and running
locally before test generation and execution begin.

## Trigger
Human confirms Dev PR merged (from `reviewer-agent` Stage 6).

## Skills Used
- `.claude/skills/file-writer/SKILL.md` (log only — see Hooks)

No other skills — this stage only confirms a manual local action.

## Input
- Handoff Summary for Testing (from `reviewer-agent`)

## Steps
1. Instruct human to pull the latest merged main branch locally
2. Instruct human to run the app's build step (e.g. `npm run
   build`) if the app has one
3. Instruct human to start the app locally so it is reachable
   at http://localhost:5050
4. Wait for human to confirm: "deployed" or "DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE"
5. Final line: "DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE."

## Output
Confirmation that the app is running at localhost:5050,
ready for Playwright tests to target it.

## Human Checkpoint
YES — human performs the build/run steps locally and confirms
before the pipeline proceeds.

## Rules
See `.claude/rules/pipeline-rules.md`. No skills beyond the hooks
log write, so most rules don't apply here — this stage is purely a
manual-action confirmation gate.

## Hooks
Real hooks in `.claude/settings.json`:
- on_start: no file input (Handoff Summary is in-chat), skip check
- on_complete: log to `docs/{{STORY_ID}}/pipeline-log.md` — output
  "app running at localhost:5050", Checkpoint Result APPROVE

## Next Stage
`tester-agent` (`.claude/agents/tester-agent.md`) — after deployment confirmed
